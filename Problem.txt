Automatic Washing Machine Controller FSM

Problem Statement:
    Design an FSM to simulate the working of a semi-automatic washing machine with the following operations:
        Fill → Wash → Rinse → Spin → Stop

        Each stage takes a fixed number of cycles

        Machine should respond to start, pause, and reset signals.

        Inputs:
            clk, reset, start, pause

        Outputs:
            stage[2:0] → Indicates current stage
            done → High when complete
            
        States:
            IDLE
            FILL
            WASH
            RINSE
            SPIN
            DONE
